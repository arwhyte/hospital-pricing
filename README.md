# Hospital Quality and Pricing

## Purpose
Compare how much hospitals' charge for a procedure to their quality rating. 

## Data Set
The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have datasets that show how much different hospitals bill to CMS for different Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG). I will compare how much a hospital charges to the CMS quality ratings. Quality measures include 'Overall Quality Score (scale of 1 to 5)', 'Safety National Comparison', and 'Readmission National Comparison' where hospitals may be 'above', 'below', or 'similar to' the national average.
